## TODO

- [ ] Environment setup guide: dependencies, simulators/renderers, and data preparation
- [ ] Quickstart (Start Up): step-by-step demo run and troubleshooting
- [ ] Repository reorganization and refactoring: clearer modules, naming, docs, and tests

These items are planned and will roll out progressively. Contributions and feedback are welcome.
